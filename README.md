# fab_pta_container
[SingularityCE](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/latest/user-guide/) container developed for using the [Discovery](https://github.com/nanograv/discovery) package. Few Discovery unit-tests are also available, together with the documentation for the container.

## Container
The [defintion file](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/latest/user-guide/definition_files.html) for the [SingularityCE](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/latest/user-guide/) container is provided here, allowing users to locally build their instance of the container. As explained in the documentation within this repository, a working installation of SingularityCE is needed in order to build the container.

## Discovery unit tests
A few unit tests are available within this repository, both in the form of jupyter notebooks and their equivalent python scripts.
